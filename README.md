## Installation

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed on your system:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or later)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) (for database storage)

### Steps to Install
1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd NodeJS-Full-E-Commerce-RESTful-APIs
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**  
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**  
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the necessary environment variables:
   ```plaintext
   PORT=5000
   MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
   JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key
   ```

4. **Start the server**  
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

5. **API is ready!**  
   You can now access the APIs at `http://localhost:5000`

## Usage

### 1. Run the Server
After installation, start the server with:
```bash
npm start
```
By default, the API runs at `http://localhost:5000`.

### 2. Testing the API
You can use tools like **Postman** or **cURL** to interact with the API once it is running locally.
